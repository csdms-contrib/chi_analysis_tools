e_bathdem <- filename prefix
0.0001    <- minimum slope, don't change
300       <- N contrib pixels for a channel. Could reduce to, say 100 or even 50. 
1332      <- junction number, this will change
0.05      <- area frac for channel pruning. 1= mainstem only, low numbers= more tribs
1000      <- A_0 for chi analysis: probably don't need to change. 
20	  <- minimum segment length. Should be between 5-20.
20	  <- sigma: some estimate of uncertanty in elevation data. Smaller = more segments
0.15      <- starting m/n for best for m/n testing
0.025     <- increment of m/n for best for m/n testing
20	  <- number of m/n values tested for m/n testing
90	  <- target length of nodes to be analyzed for segments. Should be between 80-150
250	  <- number of iterations for monte carlo analysis. 250 seems okay
0.95	  <- Not used anymore!
20        <- Vertical interval for sampling for S-A analysis. Should be scaled to DEM resolution
500	  <- Horizontal interval for sampling for S-A analysis. Should be scaled to DEM resolution
0.2	  <- An area thinning fraction for S-A analysis. 0.2 is probably about right.
2	  <- The mean number of data nodes you skip for each node of segment analysis. For LiDAR this can be 10 or more. Nextmap can be 2-10. SRTM 0-2.
